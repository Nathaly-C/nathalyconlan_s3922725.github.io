	<h2> The Poopy Robot </h2>
		<p>			
			No body likes picking up the doggy doos or cleaning out the litter tray. <br />
			I would like to invent a self cleaning robot that would do this task <br />
			I think it would be incredibly popular <br />
			It would need a database of different types of poop to help it identify between them and <br />
			plants or toys left in the backyard <br />
			I am thinking like a robo-maid but taller ( i think they are called -- which now cut the grass for you too) <br />
			it would need a self cleaning alcove ( like the auto carwash system ) <br />
			to clean the tyres and under carriage <br />
			it would need a disposal system, <br />
			it should also have a spray mechanism at the back and sides to "wash down" the grass <br />
			and a high definition camera with night vision <br />
			it would also need extra sessors on it to not go down stairs etc <br/ >
			you could program it to analyze the poops to check on your pets health <br />
			
			You could program it as a burgular /intruder alarm <br />		
			it could connect to your phone for that specifically <br />

			You could program it to be a sprinkler as well. <br />
