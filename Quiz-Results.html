		<h2> Personality Quiz </h2>
		
	<p>	I completed 3 different quizes to learn a little bit more about myself <br />
		I found it to be a real eye opener <br />
		Firsly i did a personality quiz using the 16 Personality website (click on the picture to try it) <br /><br />
		<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types"/>

	</p>

		
		<h2> Learning Style Quiz </h2>
		<p> I then decided to complete a quiz to find out what learning style I am <br />
			I found that i have changed learning styles somewhat, where I used to be a Visual Learner <br />
			I have not changed to a Solitary Learning style being best <br /> <br />

		<h2> Career Quiz </h2>
		<p>
			Lastly I decided to complete a quiz to find out which career would be the best for me <br />
			I must say that i am relieved when it came back with IT <br />
			Otherwise all this study would of been for nothing <br />

		<h1> Results of Quiz - Questions</h1>
		<p>
		1) What do the results of these tests mean for you? <br />
			overall i would say these results have made me realise that i can be quite adaptable to any situation <br />
			which i think make me ideal for a team work environment <br />
			<br />		
		
		2) How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? <br />
			To me this shows that i can work in a team when given tasks to do <br />
			but i also can step up when needed <br />
			or indeed work alone to get the job done. <br />
		<br />
		3) How should you take this into account when forming a team?<br />
			I have leadership skills, but i am also humble enough to let others shine as well. <br />
			i need to work with people that arent afraid to voice there opinion<br />
			and talk through any issues.
