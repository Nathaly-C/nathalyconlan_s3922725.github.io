<h1>My Ideal Job .... </h1>
<p>Honestly for me, I found this part quite difficult <br />
	considering i already work partly in industry ( you could say ) <br /> <br />
	But I would like a job that would be a mixture of a <br />
	Data Centre technician, <br />
	Data / Systems Analyst, <br />
	Network Administrator/Engineer, <br />
	Trainer  <br />
	
	<br />
	They all offer there own challenges, but I would like to gain experience in all aspects
</p>
<br />

		</a>
		 <br />
		This job seems like it would be an adaptable exciting environment, <br />
		it has a range of different elements and different hats that need to be worn, <br />
		from planning, implementing, providing tech support remotely and onsite <br />
		right through to carrying out in-house testing and data analysis

		Cisco routing and switching experience <br />
		Firewall Experience ( Juniper, Mikrotik ) <br />
		in-depth knowledge of OSI and TCP/IP protocols and Network Management Tools <br />
		Network Adminstration Skills ( LAN, WAN, VPN, Virtual Networks (eg AWS, MS Azure)) <br />
		<br />
		My Current Skills: <br />
		Cisco routing and switching experience <br />
		in-depth knowledge of OSI and TCP/IP protocols and Management tools <br />
		Network Adminstration Skills (MS Server, VMware and Oracle VBOX) <br />
		
		<br />
		Skills Needed: <br />
		Firewall Experience (Juniper, Mikrotik) <br />
		MS Azure and AWS exposure and experience <br />
		More hands on experience / confidence <br />
		
		<br />
		Upskill Plans: <br />
		There are some Lynda.com and other sites <br />
		I can learn how to use Azure and AWS products. <br />
		I hope this degree will teach me about Juniper and Mikrotik <br />
		If not i will have to research where to find material on those. <br />
		I would also like more experience with database software/s
