<h2>What is your interest in IT ? <br /> </h2>
	<p> I have been studying IT for quite a few years now <br /> <br />
		I started with my Certificate 4 in IT way back in the dial up days …. Nah not quite, 2010. <br /> <br />
		That really showed me the demand for IT would be in the future and the massive need there was/is for IT professionals out there <br />
		especially female. <br />
		So I completed my Advanced Diploma in Computer Systems Engineering in 2015 <br />
		which gave me a good foundation, and gave me a chance to really try it all and see what I like. <br /> <br />
		I felt that some of the teachers that taught me where lacking the energy and passion for what they were teaching, <br />
		and I was enjoying it so much, I knew I could try and make it fun for the students so I also began teaching in 2015. <br />
		By coincidence I guess as I was teaching my customers in groups of 5 and one-on-one classes also.
		
	<br /> <br />
<h3>When did your interest in IT start ? </h3>
		I am a bit of a movie buff, I started by liking the movie with Sandra Bullock called "The Net", <br />
		I would have to say this is what sparked my interest <br />
		it all grew from there, now-days i love all techie movies, like iron man and eagle eye, minority report to name a few. <br />
		Ofcourse i have to mention Star Trek (Voyager Series), I also love the series Scorpion and CSI:Cyber <br />
		I look forward to hearing what movies or series you suggest
		
	</p>
	
<h3> Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? </h3>
	<p> I got fed up not knowing how to do things on the computer, <br />
	I saw my brother-in-law and family friend building them and having fun, <br />
	and I would have to wait for their help. So, I said to myself PFFT if they can do it, so can I. <br />
	So as I said before as I went to TAFE to learn the ins and outs, and as I learned more I found I could help those people around me, <br />
	because I know my brother-in-law didn’t have the patience that I had to teach my mother-in-law the simple bits that I was learning. <br />
	At that same time I got a job at DELL Computers, selling computers, <br />
	I finished my course and got the job at Officeworks, <br />
	were I started helping some of the customers after work.
	I had started my business. I had found a niche in the market. <br />
	There is such a gap from the generation my parents and aunties and uncles are in <br />
	also to my friends and the IT that has been thrown at them now and the people my age <br />
	and the grandkids that don’t have the patience to teach their parents or grandparents or aunties and uncles. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		As you know I have 3 part-time jobs, within those jobs I have had to learn to be adaptable to the situation around me, <br />
		I need to be able to recognize the body language and facial expressions of those around me <br />
		and discern in there voice the type of response the situation requires.
		I think that active participation in any social activity is vital especially coming out of these <br />
		last 20 months that we have had in Victoria, that we need to have a way to demonstrate <br />
		and show by your actions your appreciation of the person or people you are with, and value each other’s opinions and feelings
